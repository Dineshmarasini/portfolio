                  This is a University Minor Project based on a Computer-Based
                  Population Census System, developed using PHP, HTML/CSS,
                  JavaScript, and MySQL for the database. SVG (Scalable Vector
                  Graphics) was implemented to provide real-time population
                  analytics and information visualization. The primary objective
                  of this project is to replace the traditional paper-based
                  census collection system with a digital solution, enabling
                  real-time geographical analysis of population data.

                <p style={{ textAlign: "left", margin: 0 }}>
                  This project presents a novel approach to cursor control
                  utilizing facial gestures through a Convolutional Neural
                  Network (CNN). The goal is to provide an intuitive, hands-free
                  interaction method for computer interfaces. The system
                  leverages the power of CNNs to accurately recognize and
                  interpret facial gestures in real time. The project begins
                  with the collection and annotation of a comprehensive dataset
                  consisting of various facial gestures, encompassing movements
                  of eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and other facial landmarks.

                  This project focuses on analyzing current cricket player data
                  to create the best possible IPL teams. The dataset contains
                  nearly 1,000 players along with their detailed performance
                  statistics. The goal is to identify and select the optimal

                  leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and
                  Seaborn for insightful visualizations. The project provides a
